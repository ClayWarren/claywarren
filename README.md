# Clay Warren

Builder focused on **AI systems, autonomous agents, and developer infrastructure**.

I work on tooling that makes it easier to **design, orchestrate, and scale intelligent systems** — from SDKs and frameworks to full-stack agent platforms.

---

## 🧠 Current Focus

* **Autonomous AI agents & orchestration**
* **Developer-first AI frameworks & SDKs**
* **Scalable AI infrastructure (events, workflows, streaming)**
* **Decentralized & long-term AGI-aligned systems**

Most of my work lives at the intersection of **AI × software architecture × product**.

---

## 🎯 Philosophy

* **Optimize for leverage and scalability**
* **AI systems should be understandable, composable, and reliable**
* **Long-term thinking > short-term hype**

---
