# Hi, I'm Clay 👋

📍 USA | 🤖 Indie Dev & OSS Builder | 🚀 Automating dev workflows 

Diving into tools that make coding feel effortless, I'm all about zero-config CLI magic and offline smarts to skip the hassle of manual prompts or cloud dependencies.

## Current Projects

* **DevLog** - [github.com/ClayWarren/DevLog](https://github.com/ClayWarren/DevLog)  
  A zero-configuration CLI that turns your Git commit history into a clean, daily developer journal in Markdown. It groups commits by date automatically, runs instantly via npx, and works in any repo—no setup needed. Perfect for solo devs or teams wanting shareable changelogs without the tedium; next up: custom groupings, exports, and local AI summaries for human-readable insights.

* **VibeCommit** - [github.com/ClayWarren/VibeCommit](https://github.com/ClayWarren/VibeCommit) (In Progress)  
  An offline AI agent for Git workflows in Swift, designed for "vibe coding" devs who dictate commits via voice and get smart summaries without cloud APIs. Using local models like gpt-oss-20b, it auto-generates messages, verifies diffs, and prevents stalled tasks—extensible for macOS automation. Inspired by agentic engineering pains; aiming to make Git feel intuitive and fun.

Contributions welcome—jump into the repos or DM me on X @claymwarren with ideas!
